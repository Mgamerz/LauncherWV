# LauncherWV
LauncherWV was originally written by WarrantyVoider as a way to force Mass Effect 3 to accept modified DLC sfar files. To use it, place the LauncherWV.exe file next to MassEffect3.exe and start that instead.
This version also enable the full console in both SP and MP.

This source code was modified by FemShep for better handling of the startup lag between Origin and Mass Effect 3.
